## Steps to Construct

1. **Component Selection**: Choose appropriate resistors for the Wheatstone Bridge arms based on your desired measurement range and precision.

2. **Circuit Setup**: Follow the circuit diagram provided in the repository. Connect the resistors and other components as shown.

3. **Voltage Source**: Connect a stable voltage source to the Wheatstone Bridge circuit.

4. **Measurement**: Use a voltmeter to measure the voltage across the bridge's output terminals.

5. **Balancing the Bridge**: Adjust the resistances in the bridge arms to achieve a balanced condition, where the output voltage is minimal.

6. **Calculations**: Utilize the measured voltages and known resistor values to calculate the unknown resistance using the Wheatstone Bridge formula.

7. **Simulation in Proteus**: Replicate the circuit in Proteus, apply the voltage source, and simulate the circuit. Compare the simulation results with your calculations.

8. **Validation**: Verify the accuracy of the simulation results and the calculated values.

By following these steps, you'll gain a comprehensive understanding of the Wheatstone Bridge circuit, its design, and how to use Proteus for simulation.
